  <h1 align="center">Hello 👋, I'm Varsha here!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm learning the MERN stack and improving myself by building real-world projects.<br>
    Currently working with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS.
    I like experimenting, trying things on my own, and understanding how everything works step by step. My goal is to become comfortable with full-stack development and build more real, working projects over time.<br>
    "I focus on learning consistently and writing simple, clean code! HAPPY CODING:)"
